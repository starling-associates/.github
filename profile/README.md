# Starling

Starling is a spatial insight, strategy and design studio that develops regenerative and lively environments with a net-positive impact on our future. We embrace the beautiful complexity of our planetâ€™s ecosystems and use a systemic approach to sustainability, circularity and nature-inclusiveness. We go well beyond the life cycle of the places we design and aim to foster the cycle of life that flows through them. Therefore, we develop innovative instruments that are inspired by natural principles and allow us to generate a deep understanding of the environment. We utilise these constantly evolving insights to develop strategies and designs that serve people, society, economy and the ecologies in which they reside in harmony.
